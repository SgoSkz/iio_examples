# Purpose
This repository is used as a way to track how to use the libiio library. Its purpose is to help me remember how to use the library, as well as teach others how to use it.
## Why
AnalogDevices has updated their libiio library to version 1.0 and as of now the documentation is outdated/stuck on 0.XX documentation. So I need to guess and check, find sample code (then copy and paste), or bring up an issue in libiio to see what to do.
## Issues
Issues along with their fixes (if any) will be documented in the issues section of this repo

## How to use
`gcc -liio [name of file] -o [output exec]`  
`./[output exec]`  
where anything in `[]` is to be replaced with the files being used
